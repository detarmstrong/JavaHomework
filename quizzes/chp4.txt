4.11. A java program uses integer division when a program attempts to divide one integer by another. The quotient is going to be an integer, too. Explicit casting, or type casting, can be used to coerce a result of a different type. For example, the statement 
quotient = (double) someInt / someInt2;
will yield a variable of type double.
